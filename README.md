Programming a game with zombies

I'm working with Devin and his friends to create a new game using a program language called Python.

We are following some of the examples from the book "Hello World! Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners."

I'm modifying the code to run on python 3.4 and we'll be changing some of the other examples as we go along.  At the same time, we'll be working with git and github to collaborate.
